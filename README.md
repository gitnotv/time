# Time
Use this repository to convert time units into seconds, support for s|m|h|d|w|m|y.
This is a file mostly built for me to make my life easier, this file will probably not be recieving updates unless I find something that can be added.
After you have imported this module, use time_instance.convert(query=time_query), this will convert your time with the corresponding unit!
